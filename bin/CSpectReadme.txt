   Some esxDOS functions  (F_FSTAT, F_STAT, M_GETDATE)
   128K SNA files are not currently loading
   File dialog (F2) will not work on OSX due to windows Forms not working in x64 mode in mono
   Mouse is not currently implemented
   Due to the way openAL appears to work, things aren't as smooth as i'd like. Disabling audio (-sound) will smooth out movement for now...
   Probably a few more things....



V1.18
-----
added "-16bit" to use only the logical address of the MAP file
Execution Breakpoints are now set in physical address space. A HEX number or SHIFT+F9 will set a logical address breakpoint. This means you can now set breakpoints on code that is not banked in yet.

V1.17
-----

You can now specify a bank+offset in the debuggers memory view (M $00:$0000) to display physical addresses. 
Numeric Keypad added for debugger use.
EQUates are no longer displayed in the debugger, only addresses. This makes the view much cleaner


V1.16
-----
Fixed sprite transparency to use the index before the palette and colour conversion is done
-r on the command line will now allow CSpect to remember the window location, is if you move it somewhere, it'll start up there again next time.
Moved command line options to the top of the file, as no one seems to find them. Keys etc are still below.



V1.15
-----
Fixed sprite transparency index. now reads transparancy colour from sprite palette.
Timex Hi-Colour mode fixed

M_GETDATE added to esxDOS emulation (MSDOS format)
BC = DATE
DE = TIME

0-4     Day of the month (1–31)
5-8     Month (1 = January, 2 = February, and so on)
9-15    Year offset from 1980 (add 1980 to get actual year)

Bits    Description
0-4     Second divided by 2
5-10    Minute (0–59)
11-15   Hour (0–23 on a 24-hour clock)




V1.14
-----
-joy to disable DirectInput gamepads
Re-added OUTINB instruction (16Ts)
Fixed a but with MMU1 mapping when reading, it was reading using MMU0 instead.
In ZXNext mode, if you have RAM paged in MMU0, then RST8 will be called, and esxDOS not simulated

Reg 0 now returns 10 as Machine ID
Reg 1 now returns 0x1A as core version (1.10)

SDCARD setup 
------------
Download the latest SD card from https://www.specnext.com/category/downloads/
Copy onto an SD card (preferably 2GB and less than 16GB as it's your Next HD for all your work)
Copy the files "enNextZX.rom" and "enNxtmmc.rom" from this SD Card into the root of the CSpect folder
Download Win32DiskImager ( https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/ )
make an image of the SD card
start CSpect with the command line... 

"CSpect.exe -w3 -zxnext -nextrom -mmc=<SD_CARD_PATH>\sdcard.img"

I'd also recommend downloading HDFMonkey, which lets you copy files to/from the SD image. 
This tool can be used while CSpect is running, meaning you can just reset and remount the image
if you put new files on it - just like the real machine.
This tool also lets you rescue files saved onto the image by CSpect - like a BASIC program
you may have written, or a hiscore file from a game etc.
I found a copy of this tool here: http://uto.speccy.org/downloads/hdfmonkey_windows.zip
